Once upon a time, there was a pretty girl named Lily. She loved to eat gum, especially the big black one. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help cook dinner. Lily was so excited! She loved to help her mom. Lily's mom made a big pot of soup for dinner. Lily was so happy and said, "Thank you, Mommy! I love you." She helped her mom pour the soup into a big bowl. After dinner, Lily's mom made some yummy soup. Lily loved it! She said, “Thank you, Mommy! This soup is so yummy!" Her mom smiled and said, "I'm glad you like it, Lily." They finished cooking and continued to cook together. The end.
